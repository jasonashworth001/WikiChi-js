## About
> Chicago Community Jail Support is a daily, on the ground, grassroots mutual aid project run completely by volunteers. Our mission is to assist anyone being released from Cook County Jail, their loved ones, and the surrounding community. We focus on providing direct aid that meets the immediate needs of those being released with phone calls, warm clothing, snacks, drinks, PPE, safe transportation home, and emergency housing. 

## Volunteer
> **In Person:** We operate our tent in shifts every single day. There are different roles to fill, which we will train you on once you sign up. These roles include: Set Up Van Driver, On the Ground, Driver, and Breakdown Van Driver. 
> 
> **At Home:** We operate working groups to tackle issues like fundraising, supply organization, social media, housing opportunities for houseless folks, and much much more. If you have any skills to contribute to our project, we would love to have you!
