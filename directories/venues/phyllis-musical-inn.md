## Address

1800 W. Division Street, Chicago, IL 60622

## Overview

"Chicago's historical alternative/punk rock underground birthplace Phyllis' Musical Inn spawned Veruca Salt, catalyzed Wicker Park's 1990s creative class, and hosted My Morning Jacket's first Chicago show. An intimate outpost in a now-transformed landscape, Phyllis' Musical Inn provides alternative leisure to Wicker Park's gentrified classes, ubiquitous hipsters, and stubbornly entrenched artists, recording professionals, luthiers, musicians, and writers who feed on the area's persevering postindustrial vibe."Â Live music up to 7 nights a week with open mic on Tuesdays.
