## Mission
>The mission of the Chicago Abortion Fund is to advance reproductive autonomy and justice for everyone by providing financial, logistical, and emotional support to people seeking abortion services and by building collective power and fostering partnerships for political and cultural change.
&nbsp;
We envision a world where everyone has the freedom and autonomy to create lives, families, and communities that are healthy, safe, and thriving and where the full range of reproductive choices, including abortion, are accessible and affirmed.

## For People Who Have Had Abortions
Join us for A Home Here, our post-abortion Community Circle held monthly. A Home Here is a space for people to feel safe and at home within themselves to speak about their experiences with abortion care. This space is intentionally curated to be inclusive, supportive, and open, without any judgment.  **We generally meet virtually on the second Tuesday of every month from 7:30-8:45PM.** This space is for people of all gender identities who have had abortions. [Sign up for our Summer series here](https://www.mobilize.us/chicagoabortionfund/event/631643/)[_._](https://chicagoabortionfund.salsalabs.org/FebruaryMayCommunityCircles)
