#### Overview

"The Gallery Cabaret has been operating in Chicago's Bucktown neighborhood since 1988. According to owner, Ken Strandberg, the Gallery Cabaret harkens back to a time when "you could walk into a joint, buy a drink, and enjoy live entertainment like comedy or music just for being there and being a patron." The Gallery has offered free entertainment 7 nites per week since it opened. Over time, many up and comers have graced the stage, like The Smashing Pumpkins, Urge Overkill, Material Issue and Liz Phair (while they were still up and comers!)." FREE live music up to 7 nights a week. Tuesdays are reserved for a Blues jam and every other Wednesday, Thursdays, and Sundays are reserved for open mic.
