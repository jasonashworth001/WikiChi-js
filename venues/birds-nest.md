## Overview

"Bird's Nest Bar is a comfortable Chicago neighborhood bar with a friendly attitude. Food here isn't typical bar grub - we add a unique touch to our entrees. Most everything is made from scratch. Kick-back in the rear lounge for live music or plan your own private event in this spacious room."Â Most shows take place on Friday and Saturday nights, but they are sporadic.
