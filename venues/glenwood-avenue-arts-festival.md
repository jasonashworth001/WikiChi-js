## Overview

"For two decades, The Glenwood Avenue Arts Fest (GAAF) has presented a free, weekend-long arts festival featuring 120+ artists, open studios, and live entertainment on two outdoor stages.  Attendees view and purchase handmade artworks directly from the creators.  The Fest brings free live music, performances and art demonstrations — along with street food and craft beer from local merchants on the cobblestone streets of the Glenwood Avenue Arts District in Chicago's historic Rogers Park neighborhood." The festival takes place in late August.
